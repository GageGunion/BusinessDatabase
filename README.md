<h1>Access Cookie Business Database</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project showcases a theoretical cookie business database. It provides the framework for a business to keep track of customer data and orders through tables which share a customer ID value to link the tables together. A query can be run to see the unfilled orders as well as a report. New orders can be placed using the Order Form which can create a new customer or can add orders to an existing customer.
